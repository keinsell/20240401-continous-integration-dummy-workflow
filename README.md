## Services

### SonarCloud / SonarQube

The Repository is using [SonarCloud]() to analyze source code and build metrics based on the whole repository.
It's free for open-source repositories (in meaning you can use cloud-hosted version) and for the private repositories
there is a requirement for self-hosting or paying for cloud version.

## Build

```bash
# Build with turbo and Node.js
pnpm build
# Build with Docker Buildx Bake
docker buildx bake dummyapplication
```
